# Online Judge System
Here is the django app which is the online judge system.  
For the programming questions, there are two ways of online judge.
One is the same evaluation system as the ACM competition, the 
other is the same evaluation system with the OI competition.
The former is not divided into steps,
and there will be time to punish when the error code is submitted.
The latter calculates the steps.
As long as part of the test samples are available,
the corresponding step points can be obtained, allowing the code
to be submitted multiple times without time penalty.
For multiple-choice questions and blank filling questions, 
the score is directly compared with standard answers. 
For the simple answer, it is necessary to make an artificial
review.
This app is made up of three parts,
which are `Content`, `Problem`, `Registion`.
